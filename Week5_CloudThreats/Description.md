# Ethics and Cyber-Espionage Prevention and Management

Along with the advent of the distributed computing and Internet-based computing era, security issues soon surfaced; and IT departments were faced with a whole new set of processing issues and priorities changed (Fonseca & Ramaswamy, 2014). The design of application programming interfaces (APIs) and overall systems security focused on Internet and remote availability, while system administration focused on virus protection, hacking prevention, and network access controls. Application controls remained on the backburner, often assigned little or no priority. This is one of the reasons for the growing importance of application and systems security governance and compliance and the growing demand for professionals in the field (Fonseca & Ramaswamy, 2014).

Small businesses also face some dilemmas in terms of what guidelines they must follow, since there is no general ruling in that matter. Still, no local control reporting structure or procedures exist to ensure the quality of operations is in place, providing grounds for fraud, embezzlement, and other types of white-collar crimes. Small businesses and government agencies lack alternative controls establishment, management, and compliance rules or regulations as well as application control standards.

These days, more sophisticated malware code or intrusion software is invading systems, especially emails. These attacks can be devastating to organizations because they can affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of network data and resources. Wireless attacks are often seen as one of the greatest threats; therefore, understanding strategies network professionals can use to mitigate these attacks is essential in an environment that offers wireless services and must be an essential part of the corporate risk management plan.

An organization must continually work toward an alignment that fits into the organization's business strategy. This alignment should improve the likelihood that IT initiatives are explicitly linked to areas that are critical to successful business performance, provide a source of competitive advantage and ensure ethical compliance. These must form the basis for proper application modeling parameter setting, configuration, and overall systems and network best practices for data and information processing.
