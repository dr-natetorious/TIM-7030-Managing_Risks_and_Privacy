# Vulnerability Assessments for Perimeter Protection

Cyberattacks on business and organization resources are increasingly common. Cyberattacks have led to increases in litigation and damage to reputations of businesses, particularly if security is breached and confidential business and personal data are compromised. Cyberattacks and the resulting security breaches are part of a rapidly expanding international cyber threat that costs companies and taxpayers billions of dollars each year in lost information and response costs.

Company executives are under increasing pressure to prevent these attacks and must act immediately to contain any damage once an attack occurs. Different government agencies in the world have designed guidelines and regulations to help businesses and organizations implement the fundamentals of an effective information security program.

Virtualization is a concept used for data organization and management since the mainframe and centralized environment era back in the 1960s and 1970s but has now transformed to provide enterprises and organizations the opportunity to increase efficiency in hardware resource utilization and decrease IT operations costs. By configuring virtual servers and computers, hardware resources can be used for multiple purposes or application hosting, decreasing the number of servers and computers needed. But these solutions, especially virtual servers, where X number of servers can reside in one physical server, poses significant threats should the physical server is damaged or becomes compromised.

The implementation of various security programs can be successful if the auditing of activities through log management is implemented. Auditing allows an organization to gain a greater understanding of their environment and a better grasp on how to protect that environment.

Carefully review the resources for this week. You are expected to apply the information from these resources when you prepare your assignments.
