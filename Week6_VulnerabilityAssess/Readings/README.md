Medical facilities are highly incentived to transition toward electronic medical records (EMR), because of HIPPA and HITECH compliance requirements.  These laws mandate that all actions upon patient files (e.g.: viewing, printing, modifying) must be audited and available for legal depositions.

Defense teams may argue that these files are (1) irrelevant, (2) burdensome, or (3) not part of the medical files. However, legal teams can use these logs to discover witnesses and corroborate testamony making them highly relevant.  The log itself represents metadata about the patient file which creates a direct association.  Lastly, collecting the information in digitial format is a standard process that the IT staff routinely performs.
