## Ideal log setting for database forensics reconstruction (2015)

Adedayo, O. M., & Olivier, M. S. (2015, March). Ideal log setting for database forensics reconstruction. Digital Investigation, (12), 27-40.

There are many scenarios where the `point-in-time` state of a database must be recovered.  This can happen after events like erroneous commands, data breaches, or audit requests.  While many DBMS systems support capabilities to make collect this information, the defaults might be insufficient for general scenarios.  Part of the challenge comes from varying optimization goals such as _reduing physical space requirements vs forensic insights_.  These different optimas make sense given the wide range of DBMS applications.

### What are the goals of forensic reconstruction

Generally speaking, there are two classes of reconstruction:

- __Experimental__: Seeking to confirm/refute a given hypothesis
- __Retrospective__: Going backward in time to determine a chain of events

These objectives must examine information from sources:

- __Relational__: How one datum associates with another
- __Functional__: What purpose does that datum serve in the larger system
- __Temporal__ What timestamps exist for the datum

### Where is research being performed

Despite DBMS systems being widely available, there is little research into forensic analysis with nearly all of it centering on the database log.  Most papers and books on the subject do not focus on cybersecurity, but instead come at the problem from the perspective of corruption recovery and similar debug scenarios.

Medical facilities are highly incentived to transition toward electronic medical records (EMR), because of HIPPA and HITECH compliance requirements.  These laws mandate that all actions upon patient files (e.g.: viewing, printing, modifying) must be audited and available for legal depositions.

Defense teams may argue that these files are (1) irrelevant, (2) burdensome, or (3) not part of the medical files. However, legal teams can use these logs to discover witnesses and corroborate testamony making them highly relevant.  The log itself represents metadata about the patient file which creates a direct association.  Lastly, collecting the information in digitial format is a standard process that the IT staff routinely performs.  

## Cyberattacks put every enterprise at risk: Techniques diversify as corporate adversaries get smarter (2018)

McLane, P. (2018). Cyberattacks Put Every Enterprise at Risk: Techniques diversify as corporate adversaries get smarter. Broadcasting & Cable, 148(13), 12–N.PAG.

The article discusses the slow progression of cybersecurity maturity over the last 20 years, and how the defense is not keeping up with the sophistication of attack.  Similar to concepts from [TIM-8130 Cybersecurity](https://github.com/dr-natetorious/TIM-8301-Principals_of_CyberSecurity), these challenges come from a few sources such as:

- Network boundaries being abstract
- Privacy paradox (trade offs between personalization and security)
- Humans are weakpoint to protection schemes
- Breath of attack surface for launching malware

> It was Robert Mueller — yes, that one — who is credited with saying back in 2012 that there are only two types of companies: those that have been hacked and those that will be hacked. Today that wisdom is often updated to read: "There are two types of companies: Those that know they’ve been hacked, and those that don’t know they’ve been hacked."

## Cyber-risk decision models: To insure or not (2013)

Mukhopadhyay, A., Chatterjee, S., Saha, D., Mahanti, A., & Sadhukhan, S. (2013, December). Cyber-risk decision models: To insure or not? Decision Support Systems Volume 56, December 2013, Pages 11-26. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2013.04.004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2013.04.004). [InsureIT_or_not.pdf](InsureIT_or_not.pdf).

Businesses spend millions on parameter defenses each year, such as firewalls and IDS/IPS solutions.  However, attackers still consistently bypass these systems and cause large scale distruptions.  One strategy for addressing risk is _transference_ through insurance policies.

> [Using...] Copula based Bayesian Belief Network (CBBN) model for assessing and quantifying the cyber-risk of an online business organization. The CBBN model outputs the (i) cyber-risk vulnerability assessment
(C-VA) report indicating the probable source of vulnerability/security breach, (ii) the loss expectancy report arising for the security breach, and (iii) premium value to be charged by the insurer based on collective risk model.

Breaking down this statement; a [copula](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/copula.asp) is a uniform distribution that spans a multi-variant dataset.  [Bayesian Belief Network](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-bayesian-belief-networks-c012e3f59f1b) are graphs of connected random variables and the probability that they a truth results in a state transition.  Using these concepts the exposure and risk level of the institution are quantified and then used to estimate an acceptable cost to insure.

For instance, if there's a 10% chance of X -> Y -> Z events costing the business 1million dollars damage; then paying 100k/yr insurance has breakeven of once a decade.  Depending on the enterprise size this could be acceptable terms or insignificant.

## How to approach building this model

The literature review compares various alogirthms that tend to center around

- Bayesian Belief Networks
- Utility Theory
- Fuzzy Logic

Various authors manipulate the parameters into these strategies by giving more weight to (humans vs technology) or and resource specific constraints (e.g. security budget and industry).  All parties seem to universially promote the ideas of C-I-A and encorporating frameworks such as COBIT.

After reviewing the literature there is an extensive write-up on the calculation internals.  These statistics seek to find the "fair value" of the cyberrisk from the perspective of the insurer/insuree.
