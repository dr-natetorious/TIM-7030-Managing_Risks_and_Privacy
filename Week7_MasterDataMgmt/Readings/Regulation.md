Focus on legal mandates such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), HIPAA, 
HITECH and Omnibus Rule for electronic health patient record privacy protection, FERPA rule, and many others that now requires control structures be established to protect data integrity and security when transmitted over the cloud.

## What is GDPR

The European regulation creates the legislative teeth necessary to ensure businesses take customer privacy seriously (see: [TIM-8301: Security: Week 3: Global Security](https://github.com/dr-natetorious/TIM-8301-Principals_of_CyberSecurity/blob/master/Week3_GlobalSecurity/Readings/README.md)).  These include mandatory fines for negligence that violates the publics trust, and states that individuals are the owner of data associated with them.

## What is SOX

In 2002, a number of accounting scandals rocked the financial world (e.g. Enron and WorldCom), resulting in regulation to create audit records and an emphasis on internal controls.

## What is HITECH

In 2009, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, removes loop-holes in HIPAA compliance and forces medical facilities to adopt Electronic Medical Records (EMR).  In several articles mentions of HIPAA are often accompanying by HITECH.

## What is Omnibus Rule

In 2014, an ammendent to the HITECH legislation states that Personal Health Information (PHI) cannot be released until the person has been deceased for at least 50 years.  There are exceptions to this rule such as a request from the person's care-giver, provided a written request for confidentiality does not exist.  Other exceptions allow release for insurance billing and payment scenarios.

## What is FERPA

In 1974, Family Education Rights and Privacy Act was established to give parents the ability to (1) access; (2) ammend; and (3) limit disclosure -- of their childs educational data.  These controls cover any student personal identifable information (PII) and educational records.  

According to Langlois (2014), these rules apply to any orgnaization that accepts federal funds.  She also notes that FERPA is the federal minimum bar and places like Texas have state level requirements that go further.  When a school district violates FERPA they risk loosing their federal funding, but cannot be penalized further.  However, the parents are free to file civil suits and seek damages caused by negligence and maliciousness.

## What is the ECPA

In 1986, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act grants the federal government the ability to request from businesses:

- Access to stored communication information (e.g., email and digit artifacts)
- Restricts service providers voluntary disclosure of stored communication 
- Forced disclosure by law enforcement of stored communication
