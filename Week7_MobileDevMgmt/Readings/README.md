## Examining the importance of data governance in healthcare (2018)

Fuller, S. (2018). Examining the importance of data governance in healthcare. Journal of AHIMA, 89(10), 42â€“44. [https://search-ebscohost-com.proxy1.ncu.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=132280045](https://search-ebscohost-com.proxy1.ncu.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=132280045).

Traditional data governance relies on protecting information within an application, then devising a seperate collection of controls for another program.  One of the challenges with this segmented model is that it results in numerous seams and cracks between the systems.  The authors propose that instead, a modern governance solution must evaluate the holistic lifecycle of the information across the ecosystem.

## Incremental checking of Master Data Management model based on contextual graphs (2015)

Lamolle M, Menet L, Le Duc C. Incremental checking of Master Data Management model based on contextual graphs. Enterprise Information Systems. 2015;9(7):681-708. [https://doi.org/10.1080/17517575.2013.792395](https://doi.org/10.1080/17517575.2013.792395). [IncrementalCheckingMasterData.pdf](IncrementalCheckingMasterData.pdf).

Ensuring proper controls around data lifecycle is complex when those controls must span various technology stacks.  Further complicating matters are mobile device management (MDM) and bring your own device (BYOD) situtations as the system administrators (e.g., random employee) and data administrators (e.g., IT staff) are different people.  The data administrators can _create governance but not force policies_ on these platforms, resulting is gaps in the management strategies.

> Within the framework of interoperability of heterogeneous data sources, there are two main data integration approaches: the virtual approach (or mediator) (Lenzerini 2002) and the materialised approach (or data warehouse).

The corporate governance teams can model these risks using various levels of abstractions.  However, there are challenges with explaining universal model due to platform specific design differences.  There are several approaches to mitigating these issues, such as bubbling up to broad definitions of expectations, then using providers to translate these ideas into workable implementations.

After building these models and their various levels of compliance assertions, there are challenges verifying the model.  Traditional solutions rely on recursively walking the tree to evaluate the response.  Unfortunately, in most enterprise and industrial environments the tree becomes too large to efficiently recalculate on a regular basis.  Alternatively, the authors propose several strategies that use incremental updates to refresh only the relevant subgraphs as various events request these updates.

## A master data management solution to unlock the value of big infrastructure data for smart, sustainable and resilient city planning (2017)

## Privacy Behaviors After Snowden (2015)

Preibusch S (2015). Privacy Behaviors After Snowden. Communications of the ACM. 2015;58(5):48-55. [https://doi.org:10.1145/2663341](https://doi.org:10.1145/2663341). [PrivacyAfterSnowden.pdf](PrivacyAfterSnowden.pdf).

PRISM Day, June 6th, 2013, is the point that mainstream media began discussing the Snowden leaks about the National Security Administration (NSA) program to spy on globl internet communications.  Using a collection of search engine query trend analysis, the authors examine the longitudinal influence across the American.  There was initially a spike in interest that degrades over the following weeks.  Other stories such as the Royal Baby took over the limelight, and pushed these storys into the background.  However, there is a measurable influence of focus on corporate privacy statements suggesting that its not entirely forgotten. 

## Towards a service architecture for master data exchange (2017)

Rivas, B., Merino, J. Caballero, I., Serrano, M., & Pattini, M. (2017). Towards a service architecture for master data exchange based on ISO 8000 with support to process large datasets. Computer Standards & Interfaces Volume 54, Part 2, November 2017, Pages 94-104. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csi.2016.10.004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csi.2016.10.004).

Master Data Management ([MDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_data_management)) refers to the situtations that arise from collections of artifacts being copied to third-party systems.  For instance, corporate email begins life on the SMTP hosts, then downloads onto the employees mobile devices.  This creates challenges around data governance and insuring the integrity of the organization.
