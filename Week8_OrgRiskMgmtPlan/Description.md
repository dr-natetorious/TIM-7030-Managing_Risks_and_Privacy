# Strategic Development of a Corporate Risk Management Strategy

Every organization must have a clear and precise incident and risk management plan as part of the corporate security program. This strategy must delineate risk levels; the impact they have; and how these risks, threats, and vulnerabilities will be assessed, identified, managed, and controlled in a timely manner to avoid significant damage to data, systems, and operations. However, as mentioned earlier in this course, risk is always present; therefore, you should always expect that vulnerabilities and threats present and that you will need to have a sound incident handling and disaster recovery procedure in place as part of the corporate risk management strategy.

Every risk management program or plan, as part of systems security, must start by performing a business impact analysis (BIA), an exercise wherein systems security measures the consequences or impact of any potential disruption of business or organizational operations, such as monetary and image costs per day that the IT platform is down or partially running. Once this impact is estimated, the CIO, along with corporate management or executive directors, defines tolerance levels—that is, how much time the organization is willing to assume the loss of downtime before escalating to another step, like activating the disaster recovery plan.

The BIA, as part of the incident handling and disaster recovery plan, identifies the critical applications and data sets—that is, applications that support the central operations; without it, operations may come to a halt. These are labeled with criticality levels of high criticality, moving down to moderate or low criticality, depending on the processing hierarchy or service flow. Using these classifications or categories, the response strategy is built, defined, and implemented.

The basic steps for a BIA are:

1. Define the corporate scope for risk management and the objectives of the BIA.
2. Map business or organizational functions, processes, or services.
3. Define critical systems and applications.
4. Define categories for severity levels for downtime:
  a. The direct and indirect impact of partial downtime.
  b. The direct and indirect impact of downtime for one day.
  c. The direct and indirect impact of downtime for two to three days (for example).
  d. The direct and indirect impact of downtime for five or more days (activate a disaster recovery plan).
5. Identify tools.
6. Define the steps to follow for incident response and disaster recovery.

A disaster recovery plan (DRP) is a formal plan that defines the steps to follow to recover partial operations in a remote location if the primary installation is damaged, compromised, or destroyed. You must not assume that you will be able to go to the office every day for work. As a security administrator or CIO, you should always plan for contingencies when making decisions. Threats like outbreaks, natural events, personnel incidents (riots, strikes), technical incidents that take down the network for a prolonged period, among others are situations that call to relocate operations in a different location, and there are high costs associated with this action. For the Signature Assignment of this course, you will develop a risk management plan that will comprise the action plan for incident response and disaster recovery for NCU-FSB.
